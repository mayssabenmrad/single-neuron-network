# Project description:

- The project is a basic implementation of a neural network that have only one neuron with two inputs and one output in the C programming language.
- The project is divided into two parts: 1. The first part is the implementation of the neuron:
  _ The neuron has two inputs and one output.
  _ The neuron has a weight for each input.
  _ The neuron has a bias = 0.
  _ The neuron has an activation function that is the sigmoid function. 2. The second part is the implementation of the training algorithm:
  _ The training algorithm is the gradient descent algorithm.
  _ The training algorithm is used to adjust the weights of the neuron to minimize the loss. \* The loss function is the binary cross-entropy loss function.

# Todo list:

    [x] Implement the neuron.
    [x] Implement the training algorithm.
    [] Test the implementation.
    [x] Write the documentation.
    [x] Write the readme file.
    [] Submit the project.
