# Project description:

- The project is a basic implementation of a neural network that has only one neuron with two inputs and one output in the C programming language.
- The project is divided into two parts:
  1. The first part is the implementation of the neuron:
     - The neuron has two inputs and one output.
     - The neuron has a weight for each input.
     - The neuron has a bias = 0.
     - The neuron has an activation function that is the sigmoid function.
  2. The second part is the implementation of the training algorithm:
     - The training algorithm is the gradient descent algorithm.
     - The training algorithm is used to adjust the weights of the neuron to minimize the loss.
     - The loss function is the binary cross-entropy loss function.

### Todo list:
- [x] Implement the neuron.
- [x] Implement the training algorithm.
- [x] Test the implementation.
- [x] Write the documentation.
- [x] Write the readme file.
- [x] Submit the project.
