/*
 * This file defines the loss function that we will use in this project which is
   Cross Entropy Loss.

 * The loss value is a measure of how well our neuron is performing on a given
   dataset, and it is used to update its weights during training.

 * The cross entropy loss function is defined as:
 	___________________________________________________________
  	| L = -1/N * Σ(y * log(y_hat) + (1 - y) * log(1 - y_hat)) |
   	-----------------------------------------------------------
   where N is the number of samples in the dataset, y is the true label of the
   sample, y_hat is the predicted label of the sample, and log is the natural
   logarithm.
